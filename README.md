### [Project0](https://github.com/jameszhou89/udacity-ml/blob/master/Project0-James/titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb)    
Titanic Survivor Prediction
Built a simple decision tree classifier to predict passenger survival outcomes based on features such as gender and age from the Titanic disaster dataset, achieving an accuracy above 80%.

### [Project1](https://github.com/jameszhou89/udacity-ml/blob/master/Project1-James/boston_housing.ipynb)  
Boston Housing Price Prediction
Utilized Python libraries like NumPy and Scikit-Learn to predict the selling prices of new homes using the Boston Housing dataset.

- Applied techniques such as K-Fold cross-validation and GridSearch to optimize machine learning model hyperparameters.
- Analyzed performance metrics and charts of various machine learning algorithms to evaluate the variance and accuracy of different models under various parameter settings.
- Selected the best-performing model, which achieved an R^2 score of 0.84 on the test set.

### [Project2](https://github.com/jameszhou89/udacity-ml/blob/master/Project2/finding_donors.ipynb)    
Finding Donors for CharityML
Developed an efficient machine learning algorithm for CharityML, a Silicon Valley non-profit organization, to identify potential donors and reduce the cost of sending promotional emails.

- Preprocessed data using normalization, one-hot encoding, and other techniques.
- Trained and compared supervised learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, and ensemble learning, ultimately selecting the top-performing model (ensemble learning with an F-score of 0.7645).
- Discussed the strengths, weaknesses, and characteristics of the three different models: Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, and ensemble learning.
- Evaluated feature importance using Sklearn's feature_importance_ attribute.

### [Project3](https://github.com/jameszhou89/udacity-ml/blob/master/Project3/customer_segments.ipynb)  
Customer Segmentation
Analyzed data from a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal, to uncover hidden customer segments.

- Applied preprocessing techniques for feature correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and feature scaling.
- Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the wholesale customer data.
- Utilized the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm (EM) to discover latent customer segments, revealing two primary groups: food service and supermarket customers, aligning with real-world observations.

### [Project4](https://github.com/jameszhou89/udacity-ml/blob/master/Project4/smartcab.ipynb)  
Training a Smart Car to Drive
Employed reinforcement learning techniques to train a self-driving car to efficiently navigate and reach its destination within a constrained time frame in a simplified environment.

- Determined the state space of the smart car by evaluating safety and reliability metrics while considering the total number of states (computational complexity) for optimization.
- Implemented the Q-Learning algorithm to train the AI agent to make optimal decisions based on its environment.
- Fine-tuned the exploration factor decay function, learning rate, and other parameters, enabling the smart car to achieve A+ ratings in both safety and reliability.
- Discussed the ineffectiveness of the future reward gamma in this context, considering that the traffic problem at hand is not a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
